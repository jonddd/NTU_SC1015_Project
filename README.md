## Problem Statement
* To what extent does family background affect a studentâ€™s academic performance?
* What models can best fit the data, and predict the target values?

## Models Used
* KMeans
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Neural Network

## Conclusion
* Family background does play a role, but not to a substantial extent (especially when compared with academic grades)

## What did we learn from this project?
* Clustering - learnt techniques of how to use clustering models as a form of EDA.
* Neural Networks - experimented with neural networks to see whether it would produce a better model.
* Fine tuning models - used tools such as GridSearchCV to fine tune parameters for decision trees.
