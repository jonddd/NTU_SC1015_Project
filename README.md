# NTU_SC1015_Project

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science And Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on a Student's Academic Performance. For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from: <br>
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Visualisation
3. Clustering Patterns
4. Neural Network
5. Final EDA
6. Final Model

## Contributors
* @ericaleee - Data Visualisation, Clustering Patterns [NEW] <br>
* @jonddd - Data Extraction, Data Visualisation, SMOTE [NEW]<br>
* @Kaioru - Data Extraction, Random Forest, Neural Networks [NEW] <br>

## Problem Statement
* To what extent does family background affect a studentâ€™s academic performance?
* What models can best fit the data, and predict the target values?

## Models Used
* KMeans
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Neural Network [NEW]
* Clustering Patterns [NEW]
* GridSearchCV [NEW]
* SMOTE [NEW]

## Conclusion
* Family background does play a role in a student's academic performance, but not to a substantial extent (especially when compared with academic grades). As a matter of fact, to maximise your chance of graduating, focus on maintaining good grades regardless of your family or financial background.


## What did we learn from this project?
* Clustering - learnt techniques of how to use clustering models as a form of EDA.
* Neural Networks - experimented with neural networks to see whether it would produce a better model.
* Fine tuning models - used tools such as GridSearchCV to fine tune parameters for decision trees.
* Collaborating using GitHub
* Googling and self learn new models for futher analysis
